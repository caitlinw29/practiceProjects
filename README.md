This repository will hold my practice projects. The index.html landing page will link to the various projects' landing pages.

ACNH_randomVillager is a random villager generator for the game Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It will select and show a random villager from the game. I created it to be used with the ACNH_bingo project for a facebook group activity.

ACNH_bingo is a bingo board generator that uses ACNH villagers as the "numbers". Clicking each picture will mark it off. Currently the game is meant to function in partner with ACNH_randomVillager. It will not run by itself, villagers need to be chosen.
